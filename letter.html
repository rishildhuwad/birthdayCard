            <p>Dear Papa,</p>
            <p>Happy birthday!!I could think of no way better than an e-birthday card for a computer engineer.
                On this very special day, I want to reminisce your life till date as observed or told to me and which has a great impact on my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                An incredible personality was born on 6th June,1971 in goregaon,Maharashtra. As you grew, you turned out
                 to be sharp, brilliant and jolly. You were in company of your best friends-hemesh,sanjay,santosh and lukesh, who were with you in your college days too.
                 Though attending college in Maharashtra, you never got hooked to any addictions of drinking,smoking or any which shows your integrity and values.
                 As told by you, you were a great foodie(which you are still) and had won many eating bets in hostel. You always have been a great fan of movies and songs. 
                 You never missed a movie during your college days; one still wants you on antakshari teams. You started a job in pune and after a few years shifted to vadodara for starting a new venture.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 23rd November,1996, you  married a wonderful woman(my mother) and with her back support you flourished your business. On 10th April,2001, I was born and you made me your 1st priority.
                We lived in a small house but I felt like living in palace in your heart. You taught me to walk,eat and you made me fall asleep in the warmth of your hands.
                I grew up,we changed house and I was going to school. You taught me maths,science,real-life lessons & much more so that I succeed in any field.
                You taught me to play badminton and even play with me,despite of your busy schedule.Since then you have been more of a friend to me than a father.
            </p>
            <p>Today, when I look back at my life, I see that I have been living in your silhouette.Still, whenever I get stuck in anything, you are my go-to person. 
                You also take my opinions on any subject and also consider it. Sometimes we discuss politics or sometimes any technology advancement.
                You make us all laugh, you protect us, you take tough decisions,you have become an integral part of many lives and on behalf of all of them I wish you a very happy birthday...
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>your loving son,
            <br>
